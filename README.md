In this project, we applied LIME, an explanation technique that can explain any
classifier’s predictions with human interpretable features. We applied it to three
machine learning models: SVM, random forest, and CNN that take either 1D
textual data or 2D image data. Our work follows by evaluations of LIME’s results
on the three machine learning models. The LIME results we obtained explained
how these machine learning models get their prediction, and why sometimes a
model gets the wrong prediction. We also compared the LIME result between
different models to understand the difference in underlying logic between them.
